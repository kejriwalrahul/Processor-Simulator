# Processor Simulation

Project to simulate code execution on a simple 16-bit processor (non-pipelined simulator).

## Usage:

1. Make binaries using ```make```
2. Run the code using ```./ProcessorSimulator.o <infile> <outfile>```
3. Clean binaries and temporary files using ```make clean``` 

## Assembly to Binary Translation:

Sample input file : "input"
Sample output file : "output"

## For running,

```$ javac preprocessing.java```
```$ java PreProcess```
