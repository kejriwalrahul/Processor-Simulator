# Processor Simulation

Project to simulate code execution on a simple 16-bit processor (non-pipelined simulator).

## Usage:

1. Make binaries using ```make```
2. Run the code using ```./ProcessorSimulator.o <infile> <outfile>```
3. Clean binaries and temporary files using ```make clean``` 

## Assembly to Binary Translation:

Sample input file : "input"
Sample output file : "output"

## For running,

1. Compile using, ```$ javac preprocessing.java```
2. Run using, ```$ java PreProcess <inputFile> <outputFile>```
3. P.S. : Specifying inputFile & outputFile is optional. Default, "input" & "output" respectively.
